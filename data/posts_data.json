This game is envisioned as a cozy, whimsical, and retro-themed trash collecting simulator offering numerous levels. Development began just over a month ago, placing the project in its very early stages. Upon achieving a sufficiently playable state, we intend to release a complimentary demo to engage a broad audience of gamers. We are actively seeking suggestions and new ideas to enhance the game."
